"""
This script reads schema.yaml and generates a values.schema.json that we can
package with the Helm chart, allowing helm the CLI to perform validation.

While we can directly generate a values.schema.json from schema.yaml, it
contains a lot of description text we use to generate our configuration
reference that isn't helpful to ship along the validation schema. Due to that,
we trim away everything that isn't needed.
