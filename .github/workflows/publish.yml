        # 1. Generating a private/public key pair:
        #    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "jupyterhub/binderhub" -f /tmp/id_ed25519
        # 2. Registering the private key (/tmp/id_ed25519) as a secret for this
        #    repo:
        #    https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/settings/secrets/actions
        # 3. Registering the public key (/tmp/id_ed25519.pub) as a deploy key
        #    with push rights for the jupyterhub/helm chart repo:
        #    https://github.com/jupyterhub/helm-chart/settings/keys

        #    permissions to push to the relevant images:
        #    https://hub.docker.com/orgs/jupyterhub/teams/bots/permissions
        # 3. Registering the username and password as a secret for this repo:
