# NOTE: localhost:5000 will be replaced from the test job!
#
#       When running tests, we use a local container registry to test pushing
#       images to that can be reached from the build pods. This local registry
#       is run outside of k8s, so use of localhost won't work well. Due to that,
#       all values with localhost:5000 below are set explicitly from the test
#       job to an IP that is reachable instead.
#
config:
  # DockerRegistry is a jupyterhub/binderhub class that is used to call
  # get_image_manifest, which determines if an image needs to be built or is
  # already available in a registry. It will not need credentials to the
