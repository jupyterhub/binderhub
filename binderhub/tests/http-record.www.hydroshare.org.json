Because of their close proximity to coastal waters, nutrient delivery from many urban areas can have profound impacts on coastal ecology. Relatively little is known about the temporal and spatial variability in stoichiometry of inorganic nutrients such as dissolved silica, nitrogen, and phosphorus (Si, N, and P) and dissolved organic matter in tropical urban environments. We examined nutrient stoichiometry of both inorganic nutrients and organic matter in an urban watershed in Puerto Rico served by municipal sanitary sewers and compared it to two nearby forested catchments using samples collected weekly from each river for 6 years. Urbanization caused large increases in the concentration and flux of nitrogen and phosphorus (2- to 50-fold), but surprisingly little change in N:P ratio. Concentrations of almost all major ions and dissolved silica were also significantly higher in the urban river than the wildland rivers.  Yield of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not increased dramatically by urbanization, but the composition of dissolved organic matter shifted toward N-rich material, with a larger increase in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) than DOC.  The molar ratio of DOC:DON was about 40 in rivers draining forested catchments but was only 10 in the urban river. Inclusion of Si in the assessment of urbanization\u2019s impacts reveals a large shift in the stoichiometry (Si:N and Si:P) of nutrient inputs. Because both Si concentrations and watershed exports are high in streams and rivers from many humid tropical catchments with siliceous bedrock, even the large increases in N and P exported from urban catchments result in delivery of Si, N, and P to coastal waters in stoichiometric ratios that are well in excess of the Si requirements of marine diatoms. Our data suggest that dissolved Si, often neglected in watershed biogeochemistry, should be included in studies of urban as well as less developed watersheds due to its potential significance for marine and lacustrine productivity.\",\"formats\":[{\"value\":\"application/ipynb\"},{\"value\":\"application/R\"},{\"value\":\"application/rst\"},{\"value\":\"text/plain\"},{\"value\":\"text/csv\"},{\"value\":\"application/rds\"}],\"funding_agencies\":[{\"agency_name\":\"NSF EAR\",\"award_title\":\"Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory \",\"award_number\":\"0722476 \",\"agency_url\":\"\"},{\"agency_name\":\"NSF EAR \",\"award_title\":\"Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory\",\"award_number\":\"1331841\",\"agency_url\":\"\"},{\"agency_name\":\"NSF DEB \",\"award_title\":\"LINX II \",\"award_number\":\"0111410\",\"agency_url\":\"\"},{\"agency_name\":\"NSF DEB \",\"award_title\":\"Luquillo LTER\",\"award_number\":\"0620919\",\"agency_url\":\"\"},{\"agency_name\":\"NSF DEB\",\"award_title\":\"Luquillo LTER \",\"award_number\":\"1239764\",\"agency_url\":\"\"},{\"agency_name\":\"NSF DEB\",\"award_title\":\"Luquillo LTER \",\"award_number\":\"1546686\",\"agency_url\":\"\"}],\"identifiers\":[{\"name\":\"hydroShareIdentifier\",\"url\":\"http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/142c59757ed54de1816777828c9716e7\"},{\"name\":\"doi\",\"url\":\"https://doi.org/10.4211/hs.142c59757ed54de1816777828c9716e7\"}],\"language\":\"eng\",\"rights\":\"This resource is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\",\"type\":\"http://www.hydroshare.org/terms/CompositeResource\",\"publisher\":\"Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

These predictions are provided in raster files with a geographical (lat, long) projection system and a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km grids (folder: soil_moisture_annual_grids_1991_2016). These raster files were populated with soil moisture data based on multiple kernel based machine learning models for coupling hydrologically meaningful terrain parameters (the explanatory variables) with soil moisture microwave records (the response variable) from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative. We provide a raster stack with the annual training data from satellite soil moisture estimates (file: annual_means_of _ESA_CCI_soil_moiture_1991_2016.tif) and the explanatory variables (terrain) calculated on SAGA GIS (System of Automated Geoscientific Analysis) using digital terrain analysis (folder: explanatory_variables_dem). The explained variance for all models-years was >70% (10-fold cross-validation). The 1 km soil moisture grids (compared to the original satellite soil moisture estimates) had higher correlations with field soil moisture observations from the North American Soil Moisture Database (n=668 locations with available data between 1991-2013; 0-5 cm depth) than soil moisture microwave records.
