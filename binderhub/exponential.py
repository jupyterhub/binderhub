    """
    Exponentially backoff until `pass_func` is true.

    The `pass_func` function will wait with **exponential backoff** and
    **random jitter** for as many needed iterations of the Tornado loop,
    until reaching maximum `timeout` or truthiness. If `pass_func` is still
    returning false at `timeout`, a `TimeoutError` will be raised.

    The first iteration will begin with a wait time of `start_wait` seconds.
    Each subsequent iteration's wait time will scale up by continuously
    multiplying itself by `scale_factor`. This continues for each iteration
    until `pass_func` returns true or an iteration's wait time has reached
    the `max_wait` seconds per iteration.

    `pass_func` may be a future, although that is not entirely recommended.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pass_func
        function that is to be run
    fail_message : str
        message for a `TimeoutError`
    start_wait : optional
        initial wait time for the first iteration in seconds
    scale_factor : optional
        a multiplier to increase the wait time for each iteration
    max_wait : optional
        maximum wait time per iteration in seconds
    timeout : optional
        maximum time of total wait in seconds
    timeout_tolerance : optional
        a small multiplier used to add jitter to `timeout`'s deadline
    *args, **kwargs
        passed to `pass_func(*args, **kwargs)`

    Returns
    -------
    value of `pass_func(*args, **kwargs)`

    Raises
    ------
    TimeoutError
        If `pass_func` is still false at the end of the `timeout` period.

    Notes
    -----
    See https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html
    for information about the algorithm and examples. We're using their
    full Jitter implementation equivalent.
