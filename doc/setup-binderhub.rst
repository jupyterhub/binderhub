Set up BinderHub
================

BinderHub uses Helm Charts to set up the applications we'll use in our Binder
deployment. If you're curious about what Helm Charts are and how they're
used here, see the `Zero to JupyterHub guide
<https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html#helm>`_.

Below we'll cover how to configure your Helm Chart, and how to create your
BinderHub deployment.

Preparing to install
--------------------

To configure the Helm Chart we'll need to generate several pieces of
information and insert them into ``yaml`` files.

First we'll create a folder where we'll store our BinderHub configuration
files. You can do so with the following commands::

    mkdir binderhub
    cd binderhub

Now we'll collect the information we need to deploy our BinderHub.
The first is the content of the JSON file created when we set up
the container registry. For more information on getting a registry password, see
:ref:`setup-registry`. We'll copy/paste the contents of this file in the steps
below.

Create two random tokens by running the following commands then copying the
outputs.::

    openssl rand -hex 32
    openssl rand -hex 32

.. note::

   This command is run **twice** because we need two different tokens.

Create ``secret.yaml`` file
---------------------------

Create a file called ``secret.yaml`` and enter the following::

  jupyterhub:
      hub:
        services:
          binder:
            apiToken: "<output of FIRST `openssl rand -hex 32` command>"
      proxy:
        secretToken: "<output of SECOND `openssl rand -hex 32` command>"
  registry:
    password: |
      <content of the JSON file downloaded earlier for the container registry from Service Accounts>
      <it will look something like the following (with actual values instead of empty strings)>
      {
      "type": "",
      "project_id": "",
      "private_key_id": "",
      "private_key": "",
      "client_email": "",
      "client_id": "",
      "auth_uri": "",
      "token_uri": "",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
      "client_x509_cert_url": ""
      }
  hub:
    services:
      binder:
        apiToken: "<output of FIRST `openssl rand -hex 32` command>"

.. tip::

   * The content you put just after ``password: |`` must all line up at the same
     tab level.
   * Don't forget the ``|`` after the ``password:`` label.

Create ``config.yaml``
----------------------

Create a file called ``config.yaml`` and enter the following::

  registry:
    prefix:  gcr.io/<google-project-id>/<prefix>
    enabled: true


.. note::

   * **``<google-project-id>``** can be found in the JSON file that you
     pasted above. It is the text that is in the ``project_id`` field. This is
     the project *ID*, which may be different from the project *name*.
   * **``<prefix>``** can be any string, and will be prepended to image names. We
     recommend something descriptive such as ``binder-dev`` or ``binder-prod``.

Install BinderHub
-----------------

First, get the latest helm chart for BinderHub.::

    helm repo add jupyterhub https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart
    helm repo update

Next, **install the Helm Chart** using the configuration files
that you've just created. Do this by running the following command::

    helm install jupyterhub/binderhub --version=v0.1.0-85ac189  --name=<choose-name> --namespace=<choose-namespace> -f secret.yaml -f config.yaml

.. note::

   * ``--version`` refers to the version of the BinderHub **Helm Chart**.
   * ``name`` and ``namespace`` may be different, but we recommend using
     the same ``name`` and ``namespace`` to avoid confusion. We recommend
     something descriptive and short, such as ``binder``.
   * If you run ``kubectl get pod --namespace=<namespace-from-above>`` you may
     notice the binder pod in ``CrashLoopBackoff``. This is expected, and will
     be resolved in the next section.

This installation step will deploy both a BinderHub and a JupyterHub, but
they are not yet set up to communicate with each other. We'll fix this in
the next step. Wait a few moments before moving on as the resources may take a
few minutes to be set up.

Connect BinderHub and JupyterHub
--------------------------------

In the google console, run the following command to print the IP address
of the JupyterHub we just deployed.::

  kubectl --namespace=<namespace-from-above> get svc proxy-public

Copy the IP address under ``EXTERNAL-IP``. This is the IP of your
JupyterHub. Now, add the following lines to ``config.yaml`` file::

  hub:
    url: http://<IP in EXTERNAL-IP>

Next, upgrade the helm chart to deploy this change::

  helm upgrade <name-from-above> jupyterhub/binderhub --version=v0.1.0-85ac189  -f secret.yaml -f config.yaml

Try out your BinderHub Deployment
---------------------------------

If the ``helm upgrade`` command above succeeds, it's time to try out your
BinderHub deployment.

First, find the IP address of the BinderHub deployment by running the following
command::

  kubectl --namespace=<namespace-from-above> get svc binder

Note the IP address in ``EXTERNAL-IP``. This is your BinderHub IP address.
Type this IP address in your browser and a BinderHub should be waiting there
for you.

You now have a functioning BinderHub at the above IP address.

.. _api-limit:

Increase your GitHub API limit
------------------------------

.. note::

   Increasing the GitHub API limit is not strictly required, but is recommended
   before sharing your BinderHub URL with users.

By default GitHub only lets you make 60 requests each hour. If you
expect your users to serve repositories hosted on GitHub, we recommend creating
an API access token to raise your API limit to 5000 requests an hour.

1. Create a new token with default (check no boxes)
   permissions `here <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>`_.

2. Store your new token somewhere secure (e.g. keychain, netrc, etc.)

3. Before running your BinderHub server, run the following::

       export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<insert_token_value_here>

BinderHub will automatically use the token stored in this variable when making
API requests to GitHub. See the `GitHub authentication documentation
<https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/#authentication>`_ for
more information about API limits.

For next steps, see :doc:`debug` and :doc:`turn-off`.
