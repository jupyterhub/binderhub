The BinderHub Architecture
==========================

This page provides a high-level overview of the technical pieces that make
up a BinderHub deployment.

Tools used by BinderHub
-----------------------

BinderHub connects several services together to provide on-the-fly creation
and registry of Docker images. It utilizes the following tools:

- A **cloud provider** such Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, and
  others
- **Kubernetes** to manage resources on the cloud
- **Helm** to configure and control Kubernetes
- **Docker** to use containers that standardize computing environments
- A **BinderHub UI** that users can access to specify Git repos they want
  built
- **repo2docker** to generate Docker images using the URL of a Git repository
- A **Docker registry** (such as gcr.io) that hosts container images
- **JupyterHub** to deploy temporary containers for users

What happens when a user clicks a Binder link?
----------------------------------------------

After a user clicks a Binder link, the following chain of events happens:

1. BinderHub resolves the link to the repository.
2. BinderHub determines whether a Docker image already exists for the repository at the latest
   ``ref`` (git commit hash, branch, or tag).
3. **If the image doesn't exist**, BinderHub creates a ``build`` pod that uses
   `repo2docker <https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker>`_ to do the following:

   - Fetch the repository associated with the link
   - Build a Docker container image containing the environment specified in
     `configuration files <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#supported-configuration-files>`_
     in the repository.
   - Push that image to a Docker registry, and send the registry information
     to the BinderHub for future reference.
4. BinderHub sends the Docker image registry to **JupyterHub**.
5. JupyterHub creates a Kubernetes pod for the user that serves the built Docker image
   for the repository.
6. JupyterHub monitors the user's pod for activity, and destroys it after a short period of
   inactivity.
