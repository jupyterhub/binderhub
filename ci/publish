    #       what version they need to upgrade to etc in order to be able to
    #       benefit from the merged PR in a development release.

    #       we craft a commit message like jupyterhub/binderhub#123 or
    #       jupyterhub/binderhub@123abcd which will be understood as a reference
    #       by GitHub.
