# About pycurl:
# - pycurl is an optional dependency which improves performance
# - pycurl requires both `curl-config` and `gcc` to be available when installing
#   it from source.
# - the reason we do not list pycurl here is that it is not needed when our
#   code is imported to generate the documentation and it is tricky to install
#   in the ReadTheDocs build environment.
